# Absolute filesystem paths, in the three shapes git prints them.
#
# Two things the first pass got wrong, both reproduced by the cold read:
#
#  * A bare `/...` run also matches the path portion of a URL, so
#    `repository 'https://github.com/owner/repo/' not found` became
#    `repository 'http<path>' not found` and `git@github.com:owner/repo.git`
#    became `git@github.com:owner<path>`. Those URLs are the caller's *own*
#    input and disclose nothing; they are also the only actionable part of a
#    fork (#52) or pr (#53) error, which is unclassified and returned as text.
#    `(?<![\w:@.-])` refuses a match that continues a scheme, a host or an
#    scp-style `host:path`.
#
#  * A path containing a space was truncated at the space, leaking the rest
#    of the directory name (`'/Users/alice/My Docs/repos/o/r'` →
#    `'<path> Docs<path>'`). Quoted paths are therefore matched to the closing
#    quote, and unquoted ones may absorb spaces up to a `:` or end of line.
